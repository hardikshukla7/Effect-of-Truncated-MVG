# Effect of Truncated Micro Vortex Generator on Mach-6 Compression Corner (SCRAMJET Engine)

## Project Overview

This project involves a numerical simulation to investigate the impact of truncated Micro Vortex Generators (MVGs) on reducing the separation bubble formed by shock wave boundary layer interaction in a compression corner.

In a compression corner, the flow is effectively turned back on itself due to the ramp, leading to compression. This results in an oblique shock wave, known as the separation shock. The extreme adverse pressure gradient caused by this shock leads to flow separation, creating a separation bubble where the air circulates, resulting in energy loss, decreased mass flow rate, and total pressure. This phenomenon is also accompanied by local heating and increased drag.

### Mechanism of MVGs

MVGs immersed in the boundary layer create tip vortices that draw more energetic and fast-moving air into the slower-moving boundary layer in contact with the surface. The vortices enhance the kinetic energy of the fluid at the bottom due to intermixing and delay the separation.

This study designs MVGs and analyzes their performance characteristics to reduce the size of the separation bubble, thereby minimizing the associated losses.

## Key Findings

- MVGs effectively reduce the size of the separation bubble.
- The implementation of MVGs results in improved flow characteristics, reducing losses due to separation.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of truncated MVGs in enhancing the performance of SCRAMJET engines operating at high Mach numbers, particularly in minimizing flow separation and its detrimental effects.
